## ✉️ Contact Form Setup
By default, the contact form uses a simple `mailto:` link that opens the visitor’s email app.  
If you prefer direct submissions, replace it with any of these free options:
- [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io)
- [FormSubmit.co](https://formsubmit.co)
- [Netlify Forms](https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/)

Each service gives you an *endpoint URL* — copy it into the form’s `action` attribute.
